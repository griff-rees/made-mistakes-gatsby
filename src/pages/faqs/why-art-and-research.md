It's a conundrum: I like creative projects **and** elements of research (usually *related* to creativity). It's a hard [circle to square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaring_the_circle) but it's what I like and hope to do more of.

Done well, a good creative project is steeped in good research: get details right and represent elements in ways that reflect important aspects of the world (and hopefully stuff audiences recognise, identify with and/or are educated by). Good research is worth telling people about. Researchers may be unaware of how their results could be useful: if it's correct, it may be [even more applicable than you imagine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace#Insight_into_potential_of_computing_devices).
