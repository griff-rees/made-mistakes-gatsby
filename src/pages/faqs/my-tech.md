I don't have anything close to [Michael Rose's](https://mademistakes.com/uses/) detail but if you're interested:

## Hardware

- **MacBook Air** from early 2019. Needed repair but still does the job.
- **iPhone XR** refurbished. Ok camera for the price.
- [**Panasonic GH2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panasonic_Lumix_DMC-GH2) [hacked](https://www.personal-view.com/faqs/gh2-hack/ptool-software) and sadly lost a few years ago. Still miss.

## Dev

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io) with [SpaceVim](https://spacevim.org)
- [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) for basic to published projects
- [pyup](https://pyup.io) to keep work up to date and secure
- Web Frameworks 
  1. [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) is my goto [web framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_framework)
  2. [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) for this site and learning *some* javascript
- Operating systems ([\*nix-y][nix]): 
  - **macOS**
  - [**Debian**](https://www.debian.org)
  - [**Ubuntu**](https://ubuntu.com)
  - [**Alpine**](https://alpinelinux.org)
  - [**Arch**](https://archlinux.org)
  - [**Gentoo**](https://www.gentoo.org/)[^learned-from]
  - [**Linux From Scratch**](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)[^learned-from]


## Creative

- [**Inkscape**](https://inkscape.org) - Great for SVGs, especially for the web
- [**GIMP**](https://www.gimp.org) - Terrible name, great for basic bitmaps
- [**FiLMiCPro**](https://www.filmicpro.com) - iPhone video doesn't cut it by itself[^filmic].
- **Adobe Creative Suite** - Premier, InDesign, Illustrator, occasionally AfterEffects and Photoshop.
- [**DaVinci Resolve**](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/) for quick stuff and grading

[^learned-from]: These are both [from source distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Source-based_Linux_distributions) I haven't used in years. But: cumbersome as they can be, I learned *a lot* about [\*nix][nix] from them.
[^filmic]: Decent app but maybe make the cApITaLIzAtion easier to type :P?
