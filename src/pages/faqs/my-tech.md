I don't have anything close to [Michael Rose's](https://mademistakes.com/uses/) detail but if you're interested:

## Hardware

- **MacBook Air** from early 2019. Needed repair but still does the job.
- **iPhone XR** refurbished. Ok camera for the price.
- [**Panasonic GH2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panasonic_Lumix_DMC-GH2) [hacked](https://www.personal-view.com/faqs/gh2-hack/ptool-software) and sadly lost a few years ago. Still miss.

## Dev

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io) with [SpaceVim](https://spacevim.org)
- [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) for basic to published projects
- [pyup](https://pyup.io) to keep work up to date and secure
- Web Frameworks 
  1. [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) is my goto webframework
  2. [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) for this site and learning *some* js
- Operating systems ((\*nix)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like]): 
  1. **macOS**
  2. **[Debian](https://www.debian.org)**
  3. **[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com)**
  4. **[Alpine](https://alpinelinux.org)**
  5. **[Arch](https://archlinux.org)**

## Creative

- **Adobe Creative Suite** - Premier, InDesign, Illustrator, occasionally AfterEffects and Photoshop.
- **[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org)** - Great for SVGs, especially for the web
- **[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org)** - Terrible name, great for basic bitmaps
- **[FiLMiCPro](https://www.filmicpro.com)** - iPhone video doesn't cut it by itself[^filmic].
- **[DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/)** for quick stuff and grading
